# Environment-Visualization-Power-BI
This this my teamwork project during a data science course in which we use Power BI to visualize the environment dataset. This is also the Enterprise DNA Challenge 17
The source data is comprised of 4 environmental subjects areas for the USA Mid-Atlantic region. The outcome of this analysis is to recommend some actions for specific users.
# Who are the user of this dataset?
1. **Regional Data Scientists** who will use the report as a starting point for more comprehensive assessment of environmental trends
2. **Upper-Level Managers** who are not familiar with the details of the datasets, but will use the report to track major environmental trends and will use the visualizations generated to communicate this information in external presentations
3. **Policy Makers** who need to understand the data at a glance to support decisions about how to allocate funds to the aspects of their region that need the most attention
# How do we do it?
We focus on some metrics that impact the quality of life and answer some questions that can be raised by our users. We also add text for vision-impaired users. 
This is our first project in data science and also the first time we learn to use Power BI as a visualization tool.
